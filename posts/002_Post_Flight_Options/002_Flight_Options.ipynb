    "Here are a few hypothetical flight options (not exact but plausible) for early January 2026, to illustrate choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lowest fare option**\n",
    "   Depart from EWR, go via LAX, then onward to Sydney with a long layover. Total \\~30+ hours. Cost might be \\~\\$1,600-1,800. Use this if budget is tight.\n",

    "3. **Fastest / Premium / Almost non-stop**\n",
    "   If Qantas’s non-stop (or almost non-stop) is or becomes available, or a route with minimal layover (say \\~1 hr) via Auckland (if that works), you might do it in \\~20-22 hours. Price maybe \\~\\$2,500+ in economy, or much higher for premium. Prefer this if minimizing travel fatigue is very important.\n",

    "## What I Recommend You Do: Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "To pick the best flight, here’s a recommended strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Book early.** January is high season for Australia since it’s summer there. Prices tend to rise closer to date.\n",
    "* **Be flexible on departure airport** (JFK vs EWR vs even LGA for connections). EWR might offer cheaper or better connections depending on airline.\n",
    "* **Be flexible on stopover city**: sometimes going via Asia or via Auckland gives a better total cost even if it adds flying time.\n",
    "* **Balance layover vs cost**: a cheap flight with a 10+ hour layover can be almost as bad (from fatigue/time cost) as paying more for a shorter itinerary.\n",
    "* **Watch for sales / alerts**: airlines often discount around certain times; set price alerts.\n",
    "* **Consider premium economy or business if budget allows**: it costs more up-front but for a long haul, the added comfort (seat space, meals, rest) can make a large difference.\n",

    "Putting together what people say + what you’ll likely value, here’s how I’d adjust or weigh different flight options based on reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If airline reviews show that the premium economy / upgraded economy (or whatever class you’d be getting) is significantly better (seat comfort, service) and price difference isn’t huge, going for that is probably worth it for such a long flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you pick a route with one stop via a hub with good reviews (including layover terminal quality, smooth transfers), that’s better than cheaper flights with many stops or layovers in airports with bad experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I might give a small premium to airlines like Qantas, especially for the long segment over the Pacific, if reviews suggest better rest, better service (meals, cleanliness) — because arriving well rested makes a big difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conversely, if an airline gets poor reviews in the aspects you care most about (comfort, service, treating delays well), then to tolerate that, you’d want more buffer time (longer connection), maybe a more expensive ticket with more reliability, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can pull up **recent review scores** (e.g. Skytrax, independent traveler reports) for each airline on the likely routes you’ll consider, so you can see a comparison side-by-side. Do you want me to do that?\n",

    "The LLM was able to provide a helpful and thorough analysis of different airline and flight options. It struggled when I asked it to pull specific price comparisons from different dates, but it did an adequate job of providing reviews from online sources. Overall, I was satisfied with the responses.
