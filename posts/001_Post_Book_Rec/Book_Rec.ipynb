Picking a book you’ll carry all semester depends on what you want out of the class: Do you want something more technical, more ethical / policy-oriented, more futuristic, more mathematical, more action / change oriented, etc.? I can walk you through how a few of these differ and which might suit different priorities—and then I can recommend one that seems strong for many students. You can use that plus your own preferences.\n",

Plus, it has good narrative elements, which makes it engaging all semester.\n",

    "1. **Superagency** by Reid Hoffman & Greg Beato (2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Very much a positive / forward-looking argument. The authors argue that AI can *increase human agency*, act as a partner & amplifier in work, education, healthcare, etc. ([Superagency][1])\n",
    "   * They call for embracing AI, navigating its risks responsibly, but not letting fear freeze progress. ([TechCrunch][2])\n",

    "   * This also has a generally positive stance: how humans and AI can collaborate; how using AI well can supercharge thinking & productivity. ([MiddleWeb][3])\n",

    "* **Co-Intelligence** is more practical, about day-to-day work, how people can actually use AI now, what to watch out for, how to adapt. If you want something you can apply sooner, that’s very useful.\n",
