    "For a high school kid who just got their license, the best first car recommendations focus on safety, reliability, affordability, and ease of driving. Here are some solid options:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety First\n",
    "- Look for cars with good crash-test ratings and modern safety features like airbags, anti-lock brakes, and stability control.\n",
    "- Avoid high-performance or overly large vehicles that might be harder for new drivers to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reliability & Low Maintenance\n",
    "- Choose brands known for lasting a long time without expensive repairs—Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and Mazda are often top picks.\n",
    "- Older used cars from these brands can be very cost-effective while still reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affordability\n",
    "- A used car in good condition around $5,000-$10,000 is often a smart choice for teens.\n",
    "- Economical vehicles that don’t guzzle gas are great for keeping ongoing costs low.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy to Drive & Park\n",
    "- Smaller cars or compact SUVs that are easy to maneuver and park help new drivers build confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Models to Consider\n",
    "- Toyota Corolla or Camry (used, reliable, good safety)\n",
    "- Honda Civic or Accord (dependable, affordable maintenance)\n",
    "- Mazda3 or Mazda CX-3 (fun to drive and reliable)\n",
    "- Hyundai Elantra or Sonata (great warranties and value)\n",
    "- Subaru Impreza (all-wheel drive for better handling)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tips\n",
    "- Avoid flashy or expensive cars to reduce insurance costs.\n",
    "- Keep the car in good shape and maintain regular service to avoid breakdowns.\n",
    "- Consider safety accessories like backup cameras or parking sensors if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the goal is a car that’s safe, reliable, not too expensive, and easy to drive for a new teen driver. This helps build good driving habits without extra stress or cost."

    "<span style=\"color:green\">It was interesting to see that Perplexity had given me criteria to consider without me asking for the criteria itself. I appreciated this and I liked the fact that on top of that, it provided us with specific models as well. Next, I would like to it to provide me with specific models sorted based on the criteria that it had provided before. </span> "

    "## Final Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\"> Perplexity did a good job overall with the list, especially once I asked for the details like actual prices and safety ratings. At first, it gave me a solid general overview but didn’t provide the numbers or ratings upfront, which felt like a missing piece. I had to push a bit to get that kind of concrete info, so it wasn’t fully proactive in delivering everything at once. That said, Perplexity was quick and efficient at adapting when I asked for more specifics — diving into real-time data sources, pulling current used car prices, and referencing reputable safety ratings from IIHS and NHTSA, which was impressive. The inclusion of citations made the info transparent and trustworthy, a big plus compared to other AI tools that often just throw out unchecked facts. Perplexity’s main strength is in combining web search and AI reasoning, so it can find accurate, up-to-date information and organize it well. But it doesn’t fully anticipate every detail users might want right away without some nudging. The conversation feel was pretty natural, and Perplexity stayed on topic, which made the process smooth. </span> "
