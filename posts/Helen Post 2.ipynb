    "* Use off-peak hours (before 6 pm) for less wait and maybe better deals.\n",

    "## Reflection \n",
    "\n",
    "From my point of view, the list of food options around Penn is actually really helpful because it reflects the range of what I usually look for — quick, affordable bites between classes, but also a few nicer sit-down places when I want to treat myself or meet friends. I appreciate how it covers different cuisines — from Ethiopian to Mexican to Halal — since eating the same thing every day can get dull fast. The price breakdowns also make it easier to plan around my budget, especially since being a student means constantly balancing convenience with cost. I like that some places, like Bui’s Lunch Truck and Nafi Food Express, are under $10, while others like White Dog Café or Han Dynasty are there for when I want a more relaxed dinner. It gives a nice sense of variety without being overwhelming.\n",
    "That said, I could’ve asked for a few extra things to make the list even more personalized. For example, it might have helped to include more information about hours — since late-night or early-morning options are often what students really need — and maybe a section specifically for vegetarian or healthier choices on a budget. I also could’ve asked for options that are open during weekends or offer good study environments, since I sometimes want a café-style space to read or work. Another angle would’ve been getting suggestions for delivery or campus dining alternatives, especially those that take PennCash or student discounts. Overall, the list is a strong start, but with a few tweaks focused on schedule, diet, and study needs, it could become a perfect student dining guide.\n"
