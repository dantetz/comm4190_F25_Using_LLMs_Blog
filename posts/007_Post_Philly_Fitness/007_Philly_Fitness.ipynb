    "For a 3-mile run starting at the University of Pennsylvania campus with scenic views, these three options offer memorable, picturesque experiences within easy reach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Schuylkill River Trail and Boardwalk\n",
    "- **Route**: Exit campus via Walnut or South Street, cross the bridge toward the Schuylkill River Trail. Head north along the river using the Schuylkill Banks Boardwalk, taking in city and river views. Turn around at the 1.5-mile mark for a return to campus.\n",
    "- **Highlights**: Panoramic river views, Philadelphia skyline, public art, boats on the river, and a lively trail atmosphere. The trail is flat, wide, and very popular with local runners and cyclists.[1][2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Locust Walk, Woodland Walk, and University City Loop\n",
    "- **Route**: Create a campus loop featuring Locust Walk (from 40th to 34th Street), connect to Woodland Walk (down to 30th), and loop back through the core of Penn’s historic campus. Extend west through University City for variety.\n",
    "- **Highlights**: Beautiful campus architecture, tree-lined pedestrian paths, relaxed traffic, and a collegiate vibe. This is a great way to see Penn’s green spaces and urban design.[4][5][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Penn Park to South Street Bridge Loop\n",
    "- **Route**: Start by entering Penn Park (at 31st and Walnut), follow the internal paths and bridges for about a mile, then exit onto the South Street Bridge. Cross the bridge for a sweeping cityscape, return via Walnut Street bridge for a loop back to campus.\n",
    "- **Highlights**: Well-landscaped park, sports fields, skyline views, and elevated perspectives over Center City and the river. Penn Park’s bridges add variety and some gentle elevation.[6][3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each route is easily accessible from Penn, ensures plenty of visual interest, and falls within or just over the 3-mile mark for a satisfying run with scenic rewards.[2][3][4][1][6]\n",

    "## Reflection \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">Honestly, Perplexity did pretty well with my questions. What I really liked was how it always included citations—something most other AI don’t do. Having those sources made me feel like the info wasn’t just pulled out of nowhere, which is a big plus. What’s cool is how Perplexity didn’t just give me basic answers. When I asked about clubs and fitness stuff, it really tailored the info to what a college student in Philly would actually care about, mentioning real places and prices. Then when I threw in extra criteria like price and how close things are to campus, Perplexity just adjusted without missing a beat. It even made tables to make the comparisons clearer, which was super helpful. And when I asked for running routes, I got three solid and scenic options starting right from Penn’s campus, complete with little details about the views and routes. It felt like I was getting advice from a friend who knows the city, not a robot just spitting facts. So overall, Perplexity was flexible, attentive, and gave me info that felt real and useful.</span> "
