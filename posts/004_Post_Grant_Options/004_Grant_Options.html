<h1>Grant Reccomendations</h1>
<p><em>Through my fraternity and literary society at Penn, I have access to an academic safe grant for an acaedemic or community based activity! I have several initial, vague ideas for what I could use this for. I am interested to see if, given these specifications, Chat-GPT 5 is able to come up with specific laid out plans. I will also provide it with the specific requirements for the application guidelines</em></p>
<section id="prompt" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompt">Prompt</h2>
<p><span style="color:green">I am part of a literary organization which provides grants for academic or community based trips. Examples of previous grants include trips to the Library of Congress in Washington DC or mueseums in Cairo, Egypt. I am going to be spending a semester in Sydney, Australia and would like ideas for places to go in Australia which could combine natural beauty with academic aspects. Provide me with a few options.</span></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p><span style="color:red">I found that ChatGPT misunderstood the prompt I had given it. Instead of providing me with academic locations that also had areas of natural beauty around or near them, it focused on trying to combine the two. To fix this, I attempted to make my description and next prompt significantly more specific to include the fact that I needed it to be an academic or cultural location that has natural beauty near it.</span></p>
