    "Train is the most *predictable*: no TSA, no serious security line, and you’re downtown-to-downtown. You can work, walk around, and Wi-Fi is usually “fine enough” for email. For a normal weekday trip, Acela feels like **the sweet spot** of speed vs. hassle.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Upshot (my POV)**\n",
    "On a perfect day, flying can barely edge out or match Acela door-to-door. But once you factor TSA, boarding, potential air-traffic delays, and the general airport headache, the plane only really “wins” if:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Traffic realities**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Leaving Manhattan, the bottlenecks are: Midtown crosstown, Lincoln/Holland tunnel or GWB approach, then I-95/NJ Turnpike, then Baltimore/DC approaches.\n",
    "* At rush hour or on a Sunday evening, 4h can easily become **5–6 hours** (sometimes more if there’s an accident, construction, or weather).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Last-mile at GW**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once you reach DC, driving into Foggy Bottom is fairly straightforward, but you’ll spend **10–20 minutes** finding parking, paying, and then walking to campus.\n",

    "* Typical daytime/early evening: **4.5–5.5 hours**.\n",
    "* Bad-traffic days: **6+ hours** is very possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upshot (my POV)**\n",
    "Driving is the **least predictable**. It gives you control (leave exactly when you want, no schedule, space for luggage), but you’re trading that for stress and traffic risk. Gas + tolls + parking also make the cost pretty comparable to train/plane if you’re solo. With 2–3 people in the car, it becomes more cost-effective but still not time-efficient.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **If I care most about total time + sanity:**\n",
    "  **Acela wins.** It’s usually as fast as flying door-to-door, but with way less friction and more productivity time.\n",
    "* **If I care about saving money:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Northeast Regional** (booked early) is usually cheaper than Acela and most last-minute flights, at the cost of ~30–45 extra minutes onboard.\n",
    "* **If I care about flexibility or am traveling with a group and luggage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Car** can make sense, but you’re rolling the dice on I-95 traffic.\n",
    "* **Flying:** Honestly feels like paying more for TSA lines and delay risk unless there’s a really specific reason (already at LGA/JFK, same-day connection, using miles/points, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you tell me **day of week + time of departure** you’re considering, I can sanity-check which option is best for that specific window.\n",
