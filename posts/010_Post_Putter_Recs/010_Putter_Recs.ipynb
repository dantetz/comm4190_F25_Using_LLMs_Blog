    "# Putter Reccomendations\n",
    "*Over the past two years, I have been getting very into golf. I intiially bought a set of used clubs from 2006 which are currently breaking down and are not in the greatest shape. I have since upgraded my irons, but I am in need of a new putter as mine ways more than many people's wedges and is almost destroyed. I wanted to see what Chat-GPT 5 would respond and if it would be able to provide me with a range of options based on my criteria. I am also very interested in seeing if it is able to pull from actual second hand listings such as ebay (active ones) and if it is able to provide me with photographs of the putters.*"

    "* **Mallets/High-MOI** (e.g., Spider, Tyne H, Ai-ONE Jailbird): larger heads stabilize off-center strikes and aid alignment—great for straighter strokes or anyone wanting forgiveness. ([odyssey.callawaygolf.com][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stroke type & balance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Face-balanced** models tend to suit a **straight/“slight-arc”** stroke.\n",
    "* **Toe-hang** models (plumber’s neck blades, some mallets) suit a **stronger arc**. Ping labels this clearly in fitting (blue = straight, green = slight arc, red = strong arc). ([PING][3])\n",
    "* Typical toe-hang ranges and what they mean are outlined well here. ([MyGolfSpy][4])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Face & feel**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Milled steel** (Scotty) = firmer, ultra-precise feedback. ([Scotty Cameron][1])\n",
    "* **Insert faces** (Odyssey Ai-ONE) = softer feel and more consistent ball speeds across the face. ([odyssey.callawaygolf.com][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Necks/hosels (and why you care)**\n",
    "Plumber’s neck, double-bend, slant, etc., change offset and toe-hang, which affects how the head releases. Quick primer here. ([Swing Yard][5])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special tech worth knowing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **L.A.B. Golf (DF3, OZ.1)** uses *Lie Angle Balance* to reduce torque so the head doesn’t want to twist—excellent if you fight face control; expect a (short) adjustment period for some players. ([L.A.B. Golf][6])\n",
    "* **Odyssey Ai-ONE** uses AI-designed inserts to preserve speed on off-center hits. ([odyssey.callawaygolf.com][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Price rough guide (new)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **<$150:** entry options (e.g., Top Flite) — good to learn with if you’re budget-minded. Recent “best cheap” lists highlight solid under-$100 picks. ([Golf Monthly][7])\n",
    "* **$150–$300:** mainstream performers (Cleveland HB Soft 2; Odyssey Ai-ONE at promo pricing).\n",

    "* **Arc stroke & feel-first players:** Classic blades or small mallets with toe-hang (Scotty Newport 2; some Cleveland HB Soft 2 shapes). ([Scotty Cameron][1])\n",
    "* **Face-control/consistency issues:** Consider torque-reducing designs (L.A.B. DF3/OZ.1). ([L.A.B. Golf][6])\n",

    "* Choose **alignment you actually see** (single line vs multi-line vs minimalist).\n",
    "* Pick **feel** (milled vs insert) that helps your distance control.\n",

    "* **Ask for detailed photos**: head face (for wear), sole, edges, neck, grip, shaft.\n",
    "* **Confirm specs**: length, lie angle, loft (putters are usually close to 3.5°), hand (RH/LH). A mismatch is costly.\n",
    "* **Check return / refund policy**: many used sites allow short returns, but private sellers usually don’t.\n",
    "* **Inspect upon receipt**: test face alignment, check that head sits properly, no twist, check shaft straightness.\n",
    "* **Cosmetics vs performance**: small cosmetic dings might be okay; deep face wear or bending is bad.\n",
    "* **Grip wear**: you might want to swap the grip anyway, so factor that cost in ($20–$40).\n",
    "* **Shipping & insurance**: shipers often cover damage; for expensive putters, require insured shipping.\n",
    "* **Authenticity**: ensure it’s genuine — serial numbers, known design elements, etc.\n",

    "I was incredibly suprised and impressed by the fact that Chat GPT 5 pulled the used putter prices from actual, live listings from a variety of websites without me having to ask it to. I had assumed that it would just give me a relatively wide range of prices for the used options, but the fact that I got specific listings was great."
